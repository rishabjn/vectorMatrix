I am getting characters.. but one of these is either incredibly fast or slow. I can't tell! I don't have a scope,  so no way to read the output beyond what I can see on the ESP32 monitor. \n\nI've already converted it from the 5v output to a 3v input for the ESP32 and I'm getting some chars, so i think there's no issue beyond figuring out the frame or timing, but i might be wrong. \n\nThere are other issues past this, like the data being displayed,  but if i could get the splash screen to translate properly,  I think i could get the rest.\n\nI'm not really familiar with the PIC family, so any help is appreciated.

The issue is - I can't seem to find a way to stick all of these three into a one, fully working HEX file.\n\nAt this point I have 3 HEX files, all working as intended for separate devices on my board, however, I want to make all of them work in a single HEX file through DIP switches(for example, dip state1 is mouse, state 2 is keyboard, state 3 is joystick).\n\nI've made a copy of the mouse hid project from picdemfsusb and remapped it to my own device, and I am trying to cater that to make it work as all three at once. My PC does recognize them all 3, viewed through USBTreeView, so that part seems fine.\n\nThe problem begins here - on dip state 1, the mouse movements work as I want them to, which is fine, however, once gotten into dip state 2, the keyboard does not want to produce simple outputs such as a,b,c,d,e on the screen, though the LED's do light up on-button-press accordingly. I've been having trouble to make at least 2 of these devices work on this file.\n\nIf needed, I can provide the full source code to it and the mapping system. Using the mplab8.92 and c18 compiler, since the source files already have the compiled software for it.\n\nIf anyone has any idea what might be wrong - please let me know. I'll provide as much details as I possibly can at this point.\n\nI have to know if this is even remotely possible to achieve in a singular HEX file, because I've been at this project for a month, and my finals are in 12 days.\n\nP.s. - the singular keyboard - hid does work fine, it just doesn't want to fully produce any output on screen on the composite project.",

    "title": "Choosing the right PIC  before starting a project",
    "content": "I had recently completed my first project using an old pic16f819.\n\nI did code it in C, i do not know anything about Assembler.\n\nI tried to read 4 switcheds and use that for choosing what while() run. However, after building the code with mplabx using the xc8 compiler, no matter how hard i try to optimize the code, i just get one subwhile running when i turn on or off only one switch.\n\nI tried to turn on a led using a pin while running them, it did not come on until i connected it into another pin which is always on whenever that while() routine runs.\n\nI tried to vary the timings of what is in that while() trying to pass \\_\\_delay\\_ms(variable) yet it only takes numbers. I tried writing several of them yet i can only run one of them.\n\nI am using xc8 2.50 or 3.00, mplabx 6.20 and pickit3, i can not move towards pickit4 at the moment.\n\nI do have several questions and doubts about this:\n\n1. I had learnt that \\_\\_delay\\_ms is a \"macro\" function and they do not use to take values from a variable. I tried \"%d\", \"%p\" and other operators, yet nothing. I tried a function from other developer which runs \\_\\_delay\\_ms(1ms) as many times as passed, yet it did not work for me on this microcontroller. Does exist any manner of passing variables to it?\n\n2. i could set properly input and output pins, set the clock speed and even name the pins within code. i had 4 pins as input, one of them triggers the while, the other shuts it off and turns of a led. I asked the pic to read how the others are and it seems indifferent to them. Its like i can not have them read by stuff like\n\n\n\n \"if ((pin1 == 1) &amp;&amp; (pin2 == 0)) \n\n{\\_\\_delay\\_ms = x\n\n}.\n\nArduino uses instrucctions as \"pinread and pinwrite\" or something like that, does PiCs have any equivalent from this?\n\nThe other concern i have is : i do wish to read the uptime since turning the IC on and the time the while() comes on pulling the switch; if time difference is less than x time i wish to blink a led one second, if is equal or higher than, then i would like to proceed witth the while, resetting the running time variable.\n\ni do plan to start another project using a pic16f819 wich is what i do have in my mechatronics box, is it pin-compatible with pic16f877?",

    "content": "Alright, so as the title suggests, I've got everything down. I've been trying to code my project to be able to act as an hid device for mouse, keyboard and joystick. The issue is - I can't seem to find a way to stick all of these three into a one, fully working HEX file.\n\nAt this point I have 3 HEX files, all working as intended for separate devices on my board, however, I want to make all of them work in a single HEX file through DIP switches(for example, dip state1 is mouse, state 2 is keyboard, state 3 is joystick).\n\nI've made a copy of the mouse hid project from picdemfsusb and remapped it to my own device, and I am trying to cater that to make it work as all three at once. My PC does recognize them all 3, viewed through USBTreeView, so that part seems fine.\n\nThe problem begins here - on dip state 1, the mouse movements work as I want them to, which is fine, however, once gotten into dip state 2, the keyboard does not want to produce simple outputs such as a,b,c,d,e on the screen, though the LED's do light up on-button-press accordingly. I've been having trouble to make at least 2 of these devices work on this file.\n\nIf needed, I can provide the full source code to it and the mapping system. Using the mplab8.92 and c18 compiler, since the source files already have the compiled software for it.\n\nIf anyone has any idea what might be wrong - please let me know. I'll provide as much details as I possibly can at this point.\n\nI have to know if this is even remotely possible to achieve in a singular HEX file, because I've been at this project for a month, and my finals are in 12 days.\n\nP.s. - the singular keyboard - hid does work fine, it just doesn't want to fully produce any output on screen on the composite project.",
